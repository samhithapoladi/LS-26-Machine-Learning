# Week 2 Assignment

Welcome to your Week 2 assignment for the WnCC Machine Learning Learner Space! This week you move from theory into building real NLP systems. We have prepared Google Colab notebooks for you - no local setup needed.

**How to start:**
1. Click the Colab link for your chosen track
2. Go to `File` → `Save a copy in Drive`
3. Start coding in your own copy
4. Run the "Sanity Check" cells to verify your implementation is correct

## The Main Mission: Sentiment Analyser (Mandatory)

**Objective:** Build a complete text sentiment analysis pipeline from scratch - from raw text to a trained neural network that can tell you whether a review is positive or negative.

**What you will build:**
- A text preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, tokenisation)
- A Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF vectoriser (implemented manually, not just `sklearn.fit()`)
- Evaluation: compute Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and plot a Confusion Matrix
- A fully connected MLP (using PyTorch or NumPy) trained on the vectorised text
- Compare: does your MLP beat your Logistic Regression baseline? Why or why not?

**Dataset:** IMDb Movie Reviews (50,000 reviews, binary sentiment labels - provided in the notebook)

**What to submit:**
- Your completed Colab notebook with all cells run and outputs visible
- A short written reflection (inside the notebook, in a Markdown cell) answering:
  - What was the accuracy of your BoW + Logistic Regression baseline?
  - What was the accuracy of your MLP?
  - What surprised you? What didn't work as expected?

## The Hacker Track: Name Completer with Embeddings (Optional / Advanced)

**Objective:** Build a character-level name completion model - given the first few characters of a name, predict the next character. This is a miniature version of how language models work, implemented from scratch using NumPy.

**What you will build:**
- A character-level tokeniser and one-hot encoder
- A lookup embedding table (learned, not pre-trained)
- A simple MLP that takes an embedding as input and predicts the next character
- Training loop with cross-entropy loss
- Interactive demo: type `"Dhr"` → model completes → `"Dhruv"`, `"Dhriti"`, etc.

**Dataset:** A list of Indian first names (provided in the notebook)

**Bonus Challenge:** Swap out the one-hot input for a learned embedding layer. Does the model perform better? Can you visualise the character embeddings using PCA?

As this is a hobby question, no starter will be provided.

> **This track is directly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's makemore project** - one of the best pedagogical ML projects ever built. If you complete this, you will have a real intuition for how character-level language models work.
